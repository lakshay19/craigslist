       " '\\nArne Vodder was a leading designer of Danish Modern. Studying under Finn Juhl, Vodder was one of the first architects to bypass the Cabinetmaker Guild Exhibition to build up a brand name, and instead focused on designing almost exclusively for factory production. His most prolific relationship was with the higher-end factory, Sibast.\\n\\nVodder designed this teak dining table, model #227, for Sibast sometime in the mid to late 50\\'s. The design is one of the most versatile tables in Danish Modern. In its most compact state, 42\" wide by 31\" long, the table could be used as a small kitchen table or card table. Add on half-circle, hinged drop leaves on both ends, and it turns into a compact dining table for an apartment. Telescoping extension rails underneath allow for two more interior leaves to be added to create a grand 114\\' long banquet table that could seat 12.\\n\\nThe table is in very good shape for its age, both structurally and finish. The table is very sturdy in its most compact position, with rails closed. When the rails are fully opened with the two middle leaves installed, there is a slight dip in the middle due to the long span between legs. The teak has been recently been cleaned and oiled, with the table top refinished to highlight the book-matched cathedral grain veneer. Based on the use of wood rails, this table is most likely one of the earlier production; with later production using metal rails.\\n\\nDimensions are 42\" wide by 28.5\" tall by 31\" long (most compact) up to 114\" long (fully extended). The table is not marked. Legs can be removed for easier transportation.\\n\\n$2200. Pick-up in person is preferable, but I can also deliver to a portion of the Chicagoland area for a nominal fee.
